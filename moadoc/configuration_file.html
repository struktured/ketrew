  <h1>Ketrew: configuration_file</h1>
  <h2>Contents</h2>
<p>One can always test their configuration with:</p>
<pre><code>ketrew print-configuration</code></pre>
<p>The general format used to the configuration file is
<a href='https://github.com/toml-lang/toml'>Toml</a>.
Here is a complete and commented example:</p>
<pre class='toml'><code class='toml'># Ketrew configuration file

# How much noise do you want on your terminal:
debug-level = 2

# When an SSH or system call fails it may not mean that the command in your
# workflow is wrong (could be an SSH config or tunneling problem), by default,
# Ketrew tries to be clever and does not make targets fail. To change this
# behavior put the following option to `true`:
turn-unix-ssh-failure-into-target-failure = false

# Unless explicitly told, all SSH/system calls are bounded by a timeout.  A
# given Host can have a specific timeout, but Ketrew has an upper-bound of all
# timeouts allowed  (default 60 seconds) here is how to set it:
host-timeout-upper-bound = 120

[client]
  # One can remove the colors in the output of the client with:
  color = false


[database]
  # The path to the database (mandatory):
  path = &quot;/path/to/some/file&quot;
  # What is the &#39;master-key&#39; of the state inside the database
  # (normal users should not change that):
  state-key = &quot;some-string&quot;</code></pre>
